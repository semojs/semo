# Solutions

A `Semo` solution is primarily a solution designed for a specific scenario, and secondarily, it might leverage some of `Semo`'s capabilities. If `Semo` is not used, it remains a solution, just unrelated to `Semo`.

## Enterprise-level Solutions

```
- Front-end project scaffold
- Back-end project scaffold
- Admin project scaffold
- Mini-program development scaffold
...
```

If different types of businesses are added, such as e-commerce, finance, etc., many variations can be combined. Different solutions can exist for the same type. Therefore, the ultimate goal within an enterprise is to build suitable technology accumulation, enabling standardization and technological consolidation during the enterprise's growth. This type of scaffold project aims to improve the consistency and development efficiency of projects within the enterprise. It doesn't necessarily need to be open-source or meet the usage scenarios of other companies. However, within the enterprise, scaffolds can reduce repetitive construction, improve project consistency, and save costs in subsequent development and maintenance.

## Open-source Solutions

Although, as mentioned above, solutions differ across enterprises, open-source solutions can also exist, for example, [Ant Design's scaffold market](https://scaffold.ant.design/). Currently, there are no open-source scaffolds based on `Semo`, but hopefully, there will be in the future.

Generally, it is believed that an open-source solution achieves better quality, including security, extensibility, and functionality.
