# Distributions

A `Semo` distribution refers to an entire product built on top of `Semo`. For example, a project with separate front-end (based on a `Semo` front-end scaffold) and back-end (based on a `Semo` back-end scaffold), including integrated underlying command-line infrastructure. It has a high degree of completeness, ready for direct delivery to production environments. It could be used for various scenarios like SaaS products, sales demos, or private deployments, and may involve related technologies such as container orchestration and code encryption.

Unfortunately, to date, no `Semo` distribution has been released. It remains merely a concept, with hopes for one in the future.
