# Distribution

The concept of the `Semo` distribution is based on building the entire product using `Semo`. For example, in projects with frontend and backend separation, the frontend is based on the `Semo` frontend scaffolding, the backend is based on the `Semo` backend scaffolding, and there is integration of underlying command-line infrastructure. This results in a high degree of completeness, suitable for direct deployment in production environments. It can be a SaaS-level product, used for sales demonstrations, private deployments, and other scenarios. It also involves related technologies such as container orchestration and code encryption.

Unfortunately, as of now, there has not been any `Semo` distribution available. It is still in the conceptual stage, and we hope it will become available in the future.
