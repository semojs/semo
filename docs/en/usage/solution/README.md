# Solutions

`Semo` solutions are first and foremost solutions tailored to specific scenarios. Secondly, they leverage some of `Semo`'s capabilities. If `Semo` is not used, then it is still a solution, unrelated to `Semo`.

## Enterprise Solutions

```
- Frontend project scaffolding
- Backend project scaffolding
- Admin project scaffolding
- Mini-program development scaffolding
...
```

If combined with different types of businesses, such as e-commerce, finance, and so on, various variants can be formed. Even the same type can have different solutions. Therefore, in the end, we accumulate technical expertise that suits our own enterprise, enabling us to achieve standardization and technological accumulation in the enterprise development process. These scaffolding projects are designed to improve the consistency and efficiency of internal projects in an enterprise. They may not necessarily need to be open-source or meet the usage scenarios of other companies. However, internally within the enterprise, scaffolding can reduce redundant construction, improve project consistency, and save costs for future development and maintenance.

## Open-Source Solutions

Although solutions vary from one enterprise to another, there can still be open-source solutions. For example, [Ant Design's Scaffold Market](https://scaffold.ant.design/). Currently, there are no open-source scaffolding projects based on `Semo`, but hopefully, there will be in the future.

Generally, we believe that an open-source solution would achieve better quality, including security, scalability, and functionality.
