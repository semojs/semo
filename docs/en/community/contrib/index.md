# How to Contribute

## Adoption and Use

There are many choices for standardizing command-line implementation methods. In general, having a standard is better than not having one. If your team already has its own standards, then there's no need to adopt `Semo`'s standard. However, if your team hasn't standardized command-line operations before, you might want to give `Semo` a try. If you happen to favor `yargs`, some of `Semo`'s ideas might be insightful to you as well.

`Semo` can be used in many areas, including development, testing, deployment, operations, and even non-business scenarios like web scraping.

## Writing Documentation

The documentation for `Semo` needs to be gradually improved with everyone's help. Some usage tips may not be mentioned in the documentation yet, so feel free to explore and share your findings.

## Writing Plugins

There are two types of plugins here. One type can play a role in technology accumulation in enterprise-level projects by encapsulating common operations and logic into plugins. The other type is personal creative plugins, unrelated to business, which can implement and share creative works.

## Contributing Code

Contributing code, whether it's for using in business projects, creating creative plugins, or participating in the development of core features, is a great way to give back to the community.

## Helping Identify Issues

Whether it's code or documentation, many issues may remain undiscovered, such as outdated code, typos in documentation, or inaccuracies due to continuous improvement and upgrades. It requires everyone's collaborative efforts to maintain and improve them.
