# How to Contribute

## Adoption and Usage

Regarding how to standardize command-line implementation, there are certainly many options. Generally speaking, having a standard is definitely better than not having one. If your team already has its own standards, there's no need to adopt the `Semo` standard. However, if your team hasn't standardized command-line scripts before, consider trying it. If you also happen to favor `yargs`, some of `Semo`'s ideas might be insightful for you.

`Semo` can be used in many places: development, testing, deployment, operations, and even non-business scenarios like web crawlers...

## Writing Documentation

`Semo`'s documentation needs everyone's help to gradually improve. Some usage tips might not yet be mentioned in the documentation. We welcome you to explore and share your discoveries.

## Writing Plugins

Plugins here fall into two categories: one type can play a role in consolidating technology within enterprise projects, encapsulating common operations and logic into plugins; the other type is personal creative plugins, unrelated to business, which can implement and share some creative works.

## Contributing Code

Whether using it in business projects, developing creative plugins, or participating in core feature development, these are all great ways to give back to the community.

## Helping Find Issues

Both code and documentation might contain many undiscovered issues, such as outdated code, typos in documentation, or parts of the documentation becoming inaccurate due to continuous improvements and upgrades. These all require everyone to maintain and improve them through collaborative efforts.
