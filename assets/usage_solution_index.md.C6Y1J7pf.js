Therefore, in the end, we accumulate technical expertise that suits our own enterprise, enabling us to achieve standardization and technological accumulation in the enterprise development process. These scaffolding projects are designed to improve the consistency and efficiency of internal projects in an enterprise. They may not necessarily need to be open-source or meet the usage scenarios of other companies. However, internally within the enterprise, scaffolding can reduce redundant construction, improve project consistency, and save costs for future development and maintenance.</p><h2 id="open-source-solutions" tabindex="-1">Open-Source Solutions <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-solutions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Open-Source Solutions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Although solutions vary from one enterprise to another, there can still be open-source solutions.
