For example, in projects with frontend and backend separation, the frontend is based on the <code>Semo</code> frontend scaffolding, the backend is based on the <code>Semo</code> backend scaffolding, and there is integration of underlying command-line infrastructure. This results in a high degree of completeness, suitable for direct deployment in production environments. It can be a SaaS-level product, used for sales demonstrations, private deployments, and other scenarios.
