# Semo principles

## Efficiency

- Make development faster and easier
- Make daily operation more efficient

## Consistency

- Core commands
- Npm commands
- Application commands

They are all same style. If we run business in micro-service, there are a lot of services for one application. Consistant command line tools may help us more.

## Flexibility

- We can share
- We can override other plugins temporary or permanent
- We can hook in
- We can config
